  <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>In the dawn of an internet era soon to be dominated by streamers and influencers, for Tim, getting paid to play Astrobloc, the most popular strategy game in e-sports, would be the dream.</p>
    <p>When Tim, Chase, and Mason—better known as Klex, Hawk, and Saygee—show up to a hotel LAN tournament as unknowns, they perform better than expected. They recruit Cerkash and iLoveDo to form the perfect squad, and pretty soon millions of fans are gossiping about their team, the Peacemakers, as they compete for the top spot in the league. With Tim’s creativity and Chase’s mechanical precision, they start to look unstoppable. But just as their egos spin out of control, other teams are catching up to their advantages. Breaking in might have been easy, but staying on top becomes impossible. And they have to wonder if they’ll even keep the dream alive. </p>
    <p>Through All-Stars events in Paris and Las Vegas, 16-hour grinds in the team house, boot camping in Korea, gaming addiction, burnout, toxicity, social media pressures, trash-talking rival teams, and clinging to the hope of winning the trophy as a team, Astrobloc is the ideal sports story for computer nerds. </p>
